### About Me

Hi! My name is Shanley Camara and I am an early career data scientist/data engineer based out of New Hampshire. I graduated summa cum laude from University of New England in May 2022 with a Bachelor's of Science in Data Science and a minor in Biological Sciences with a 3.98 GPA. Through my academics I have loved learning about machine learning and AI, learning new programs and tools for data analysis and visualization, and finding ways to intersect data science with biological sciences. I am always eager to continue learning even after completing my formal education by keeping up with new technologies in the data science world.

A passion for data analysis and visualization lead me to specialize in Geospatial Information Systems (GIS) in my early career, starting with a GIS internship and continuing as a Geospatial Data Engineer. These professional opportunities have allowed me to gain a lot of experience in data gathering, data wrangling, and database management with SQL in the unique and highly visual subset of spatial data. In my time with Maprisk, acquired by Insurity, I became an integral part of the team by taking on large data gathering and data wrangling projects, improving data quality assurance practices, improving database managment practices by writing queries, writing detailed documentation, and assisting in customer requests and communication all while working remotely with minimal supervision. 

Now for the fun stuff: hobbies and interests. I am an avid animal lover (pet pictures always acceptable), fabric art creator, painter, video game enthusiast, skier, hiker, and powerlifter. Knitting in particular is my favorite art, which is something that I picked up in college and even co-founded and was president of a fabric art club for knitters, crocheters, and people who wanted to learn. I love being able to use my creativity to design and make cozy wearable pieces. Being a New Hampshire resident means that I have access to some beautiful places to ski and hike, and these have ignited a passion for physical fitness. These things have taught me consistency, diligence, and a willingness to learn are all important aspects of a healthy work-life balance and lifestyle.

### Projects

- [Spotify Recommendation System](https://github.com/scamara129/song_recommendor)
This project uses Python to create a Spotify recommendation system by comparing cosine similarity of an input song and all tracks found in this [1.2+ million song dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rodolfofigueroa/spotify-12m-songs?reso=) from Kaggle. Clustering, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, is utilized to reduce the processing time of this system by only comparing the input song to other songs within its cluster. I was inspired to create this to find new songs based on a song I like that is independent from artist or genre, and instead base recommendations on song composition metrics provided by Spotify's API. Some of these metrics include danceability, energy, valence, etc. that may be able to quantify the overall "vibe" of a song. This was a fun project because I got to explore some of Spotify's open developer tools like Spotify for Developers, Spotify API, and the Python package 'spotipy', and listen to some fun new songs that I may not have found otherwise.
  - Skills: Python (pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib), machine learning (unsupervised, clustering), data visualization, data exploration
